	Simple chat program in development in order to learn about socket programing,
the basics of network programing, and C++ in general.
	It has both a ui-Client as well as a terminal-Client. Though at the moment the ui
is very primitive. It has the ability to connect to the server via the File menu or hot-keys,
with additional features to be added.

Any suggestions to add features are welcomed just post on issues board.
